<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://fixmyjaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/jaw.jpg"><img class="right" title="jaw" src="http://fixmyjaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/jaw.jpg" alt="Mandible and Maxilla" width="260" height="218" /></a>From Wikipedia:

Orthognathic surgery is surgery to correct conditions of the jaw and face related to structure, growth, sleep apnea, TMJ disorders or to correct orthodontic problems that cannot be easily treated with braces. It is also used in treatment of congenital conditions like cleft palate. Bones can be cut and re-aligned, held in place with either screws or plates and screws.

<strong>The Surgeon</strong>

Orthognathic surgery is performed by an oral and maxillofacial surgeon almost always in collaboration with orthodontic treatment, often including braces before and after surgery, and retainers after the final removal of braces. Orthognathic surgery is often needed after reconstruction of cleft palate or other major craniofacial anomalies. Careful coordination between the surgeon and orthodontist is essential to ensure that the teeth will fit correctly after the surgery.

<strong>Planning</strong>

Planning for the surgery usually involves input from a multidisciplinary team. Involved professionals are Oral and Maxillofacial surgeons, Orthodontists, and sometimes a Speech and language therapist. As the surgery usually results in a noticeable change in the patient's face a psychological assessment is occasionally required to assess patient's need for surgery and its predicted effect on the patient.

Radiographs and photographs are taken to help in the planning and there is software to predict the shape of the patient's face after surgery, which is useful both for planning and for explaining the surgery to the patient and the patient's family. Advanced software can allow the patient to see the predicted results of the surgery.

<strong>The Procedure</strong>

The surgery might involve one jaw or the two jaws during the same procedure. The modification is done by making cuts in the bones of the mandible and / or maxilla and repositioning the cut pieces in the desired alignment. Usually surgery is performed under general anaesthetic and using nasal tube for intubation rather than the more commonly used oral tube; this is to allow wiring the teeth together during surgery. The surgery often does not involve cutting the skin, and instead, the surgeon is often able to go through the inside of the mouth.

Cutting the bone is called osteotomy and in case of performing the surgery on the two jaws at the same time it is called a bi-maxillary osteotomy (two jaws bone cutting) or a maxillomandibular advancement. The bone cutting is traditionally done using special electrical saws and burs, and manual chisels. Recently a machine that can make the bone cuts using ultra-sound waves has been introduced; this is yet to be used on a wide scale. The maxilla can be adjusted using a " Lefort I" level osteotomy (most common). Sometimes the midface can be mobilised as well by using a Lefort II, or Lefort III osteotomy. These techniques are utilized extensively for children suffering from certain craniofacial abnormalities such as Crouzon syndrome.

The jaws will be wired together (inter-maxillary fixation) using stainless steel wires during the surgery to insure the correct re-positioning of the bones. This in most cases is released before the patient wakes up. If the surgeon is not satisfied with the anchoring, he may elect to keep the jaws wired together. This is a considerably recent modification as the usage of the modern types of bone plates reduced the need for wiring the jaws together for a few weeks after surgery as was the case before. Some surgeons prefer to wire the jaws shut anyway to ensure proper healing of the bones, but they are becoming more of a minority among orthognathic surgeons.

<strong>Complications</strong>

Like any other surgery, there can be some complications like bleeding, swelling, infection, nausea and vomiting. There could also be some numbness in the face due to nerve damage. The numbness may be either temporary, or, more rarely, permanent. In general, complications of this surgery occur, but not frequently.

If the surgery involved the upper jaw, then the surgery could have an effect on the shape of the patient's nose. This can be minimised by careful planning and accurate execution of the surgical plan. Sometimes, this is considered part of the benefit.

Root Canal/s (some teeth have more than one root canal) treatment is sometimes required after surgery, especially when the surgery involves a maxillary osteotomy. In recent years, techniques have been created that may help reduce the need for root canal surgery, however, it is still a common complication that can occur.

<strong>After the Operation</strong>

After orthognathic surgery, patients are often required to adhere to an all-liquid diet. After time, soft food can be introduced, and then hard food. Diet is very important after the surgery, to accelerate the healing process. Weight loss due to lack of appetite and the liquid diet is common, but should be avoided if possible. Normal recovery time can range from a few weeks for minor surgery, to up to a year for more complicated surgery.

For some surgeries, pain may be minimal due to minor nerve damage and lack of feeling. Doctors will prescribe pain medication and prophylactic antibiotics to the patient. Many doctors recommend that the patient rent a specialized machine that circulates cold water through pads on the face to help the swelling go down. Most of the swelling will disappear in the first few weeks, but some may remain for a few months.

The surgeon will see the patient for check-ups frequently, to check on the healing, check for infection, and to make sure nothing has moved. The frequency of visits will decrease over time. If the surgeon is unsatisfied with the way the bone is mending, he may recommend additional surgery to rectify whatever may have shifted. It is very important to avoid any chewing until the surgeon is satisfied with the healing.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href='http://fixmyjaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/carrie-old.jpg'><img src="http://fixmyjaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/carrie-old.jpg" alt="Carrie as a youngster" title="carrie-baby" width="200" height="234" class="right" /></a>My name is Carrie Scaife. It's hard for me to talk about myself. I don't know exactly where to begin. I am a teacher, a videographer, a daughter, a sister, a friend, and a girlfriend. I have no money. In 1997 I graduated from Gladstone High School in Gladstone, Oregon. I graduated number seven in my class as a member of the national honor society. I went to Pacific University in Forest Grove, Oregon and began my educational career. After my first degree, bachelor's in Film, I went back for another. I have been teaching middle school English for four years now and I don't regret a second of it. I love teaching and oddly enough I love middle schoolers (I know it's hard to believe). I also work at Willamette Falls Television, a small cable access station in Oregon City, Oregon. Even with two jobs, at the end of every month my bank account is at around $20. I bought a house last year and I have so many student loans to pay back that I cringe to even think about it. My boyfriend and I often joke about paying off my student loans with my retirement. It's funny because it's true. That's how long I will have this debt. 

With that said, I am in need of orthognathic surgery. This surgery would correct the placement of my jaw. As orthodontic is correcting your teeth, orthognathic is correcting your jaw. Insurance companies, for the most part, think of this surgery as being elective or cosmetic. I have to disagree. I know that braces are elective. You can live your whole life with crooked teeth and get along just fine. I have paid for my braces entirely and I have worked hard to do it. It was a sacrifice I made willingly. This surgery though is not just a part of the process. For me, it is life changing. There are pictures on this page. One of me as a child and one of me now. Look at the baby picture, really look at it. My jaw looks totally normal, defined even. Then look at it now. My face has totally changed. I have learned that the human jaw grows at it's own pace and there's really nothing we can do about it. Mine happened to grow unevenly. The upper jaw grew down much more than the rest of my face, proportionally. It is known as "long face syndrome." Because of this, my smile is gummy and my jaw is recessed. This part of the problem is, admittedly, cosmetic. However, this growth has had additional consequences. I am a mouth breather. I have been for quite some time now. I actually have a very difficult time breathing through my nose at all. I have had surgeries to correct the problem but they have had little to no effect in the long run. I recently saw an ENT specialist, Dr. Pederson (another great doc), he said that my nasal passages were a normal size. My problem is my jaw. Since it is so recessed, it pushes my tongue further back into my throat. This blocks air from my  nasal passages. So this surgery is not just to fix my face, it's going to change my life. Imagine an end to all of that snoring! This surgery could actually change my ability to breathe. It can keep me from sleeping with a C-PAP machine like all of my relatives. It could keep me from getting sleep apnea. 

This section is supposed to be about me. I have had a hard year. I don't know what else to say. I need this surgery. My insurance company wont pay for it. I can't pay for it myself. I need your help. That's all there is to it. I want to continue teaching. I want to continue making videos. I want to continue riding my bike. I want to get my braces off. I don't think these are unreasonable things to ask for. In order to have the quality of life that I want to have, I need to get this surgery. Please help.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have had braces for about eight years of my life. When I was in fifth grade, my parents spent every last cent they had getting me the braces I needed. Being orthodontic novices, they found a reputable orthodontist and my treatment began. I had a tooth extracted, so I'm now lopsided, and I diligently wore awesome neon rubberbands for the duration of my treatment. I was a teenager. I certainly wasn't perfect in my cleaning habits or headgear wearing, but I did everything I was told. In my sophomore year, I still had braces. When I hit the five year mark and it looked as though they were never coming off, my mom and I sat down for a talk. We decided it was time for them to come off regardless of what the doctor had to say about it. There had been little improvement in my bite since about the three year mark and having useless braces seemed like a waste of everyone's time. My parents and I joked about me paying for my own braces later when I had lots of money (little did any of us know I was going to become a teacher - money, ha!). The braces were removed and I got to finish junior and senior year metal free.

Cut to 2006, over ten years later. My teeth were still crooked and I now had insurance that I wasn't going to lose anytime soon. I did my own research this time. I chose a doctor that had treated many people I know and love. The Dischinger Team in Lake Oswego is an amazing place for anyone to get orthodontic treatment. I would send anyone their way. I had initial appointments with them and discussed my bite, missing tooth (which was pulled by my previous doc, now a detriment to my bite), and the possibility of surgery. Dr. Bill Dischinger explained that my problem was more than an orthodontic one. Braces could do a lot but I would also need surgery to correct my overall bite. I have what is known as "long face syndrome." Basically, my upper jaw grew out of proportion to the rest of my face. This causes my smile to be gummy and my lower jaw to be recessed. Armed with all of this information, I began my second arduous journey into the wonder of braces. That was February 14, 2006. At this point I have had my braces for two and a half years. I cannot get them removed until I have the necessary surgery and that is another subject.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Oh, the American medical insurance system.....I've heard it's the best in the world and that I should be happy with the services I have available to me. Meh, I'm not impressed. Again, I am a novice at this whole adult thing. Yes, I am 29 years old and should be able to take care of myself, but I have loving parents and they let me depend on them. I still talk to my mom everyday (I'm not joking I call her everyday. When they were in Mexico I was like, "Crap, I need to tell mom about this or that." I kept calling their answering machine). Anyway, this is my first headlong leap into the politics of medical insurance and I hit my head on sharp rocks and came out bloody. 

I have pretty good insurance, Healthnet. They have covered anything I've ever needed until now. Orthognathic surgery, which is corrective jaw surgery, is absolutely, positively never ever ever ever covered by my plan. I have appealed. I have had my doctors appeal. I have investigated changing plans and even changing companies. What I have found is that my surgery is simply seen as elective/cosmetic and it will not be covered. When I first met Dr. Beadnell, my oral and maxillofacial surgeon (who also rocks - best doc ever) he explained that most insurance companies just don't cover this surgery. What I wonder is how a surgery that will help me breathe, help my teeth, possibly help with my chronic snoring and chronic headaches, and most importantly will make it so that when my lips are at rest they are not 6mm away from one another is cosmetic. It's not like I'm asking for a nose job here, I just want my lips to physically meet. It seems simple to me, but whenever you involve insurance companies things that seem simple become extremely complicated. Simply put they are paying $0 for my surgery. 

This surgery will cost anywhere from $20,000 to $35,000. That's a lot of money for anyone. When I got my final denial letter the other day, I discovered a new purpose...finding affordable surgery. I have made the decision to travel to India to get the surgery. I am in the process of getting bids right now. I will continue to update the progress.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[As I started looking for affordable surgery abroad, I found two great companies that help silly Americans like myself with the whole process. I'm continuing to work with both of them because I think having options when you are doing something crazy like going to India for surgery is a good thing. I am working with Indian Health Guru and Healthbase. Both companies research doctors and facilities that specialize in your treatment. They arrange a hospital stay, all of your surgery, food, and accommodations and even help with accommodations for someone accompanying you. They help you get a visa and required vaccinations and they even pick you up at the airport. Every time I tell anyone I am considering India they look at me like I'm crazy. I love how Americans assume that if they get medical service anywhere but here it's going to be less than perfect. There are piles of testimonials from Americans, Canadians, and Australians on both webpages. I will do my research before I travel and I will be fine. 

I lost my passport recently, so pending it arriving after my new application, I hope to travel to India at the end of July. I only have one bid in so far and it is a third of what I would pay here including airfare for my boyfriend and me and everything we will need when we are there. This seems promising!

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm still undecided about where I'm going to end up. The only factor is the cost. As I mentioned in the insurance post, this surgery would cost anywhere from $20,000 to $35,000 here in the United States. As I researched other Americans who have had similar procedures, some even paid up to $45,000 when all was said and done. If I travel to Mexico or India, the surgery will be around $9,000 including airfare and accommodations. This seems like a way more realistic expense. Whichever one is cheaper overall is where I'm headed. One company is recommending I go to Monterrey, Mexico. The surgery costs more, but the flight is a lot cheaper. The other company is recommending India. The surgery is cheap, but the flight goes up on an almost daily basis. I think I will have to continue with both companies until one emerges as being significantly less expensive. Thank you so much to the people who have donated to the cause. It makes me feel a little bit like a beggar when people I know give me money. My boyfriend keeps reminding me that the whole point is getting help, but I guess I envisioned strangers happening upon the page and donating untold riches to me. Thus far, it has only been my own friends who have given, and I must say it makes me feel a little guilty. Thanks again to everyone who is reading this and praying for my safe flight, speedy recovery, and safe return. Thanks also to those who have donated their hard earned money to me. I hardly deserve it.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I got my first bid back from Mexico. It looked good except for one thing. The surgeon insists he will need to do three separate surgeries. I don't know why because my surgeon here only needed to do one, but the doctor wouldn't let me argue. I cannot travel to Mexico three separate times. I don't have that much free time, unfortunately. I also hit another bump in the road today. I knew it was coming but I was in denial until I actually opened the envelope. In preparation for my surgery I participated in a sleep study. My doctor sent me to a hospital outside of my insurance plan. I am, admittedly, an insurance idiot. I assumed my doctor had taken care of things I should have taken care of. My insurance will not pay for the sleep study since I went to a forbidden hospital. It seems like a silly policy to me, denying people care based on politics, but I'm not in charge of these things. I tried to fight it, but like every battle I've waged with the insurance company thus far, I lost. Anyway, my $2,700 bill did arrive today. I will be paying it off for probably the next three years or so. Luckily hospitals are pretty cool about letting you make small payments. It took us just under two years to pay off Mickey's knee adjustment in Tallahassee during his second bike trip (go to deaglexplore.com for more details about that). Anyway, I still have hope that things will work out. Things happen for a reason and God never gives you more than you can handle. India here I come. I'll keep you posted.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I finally got information that I liked hearing. I got a reasonable bid and a doctor who knew exactly what I needed. I have a few more steps to take with my orthodontist, but it looks like this is really happening. In theory, Mickey and I will be heading to India around the 23rd of July. Today I spent time researching how to get visas and also looking for the cheapest flight I could find. I also need to find a hotel for Mickey to stay in that won't break the bank. I have a lot of work to do between now and then. Thanks again to those of you who have donated to help. I have about 1/5 of what I need to pay for the trip and surgery. That's better than nothing!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, since yesterday I have completely changed my mind. I've spent the day in contact with a surgeon in Costa Rica and it looks like going there with save us around $3000. I'm sending a bunch of stuff: xrays, CT scans, impressions, etc. down to Costa Rica tomorrow. This doctor has made me feel incredibly enthusiastic about the whole trip. He was educated in Germany and in Costa Rica and has an established practice that specializes in Oral and Maxillofacial treatment, which is exactly what my surgeon here specializes in. I will keep everybody updated but if all goes as planned we will leave around the 22nd or 23rd of July for Costa Rica. Thanks again to everyone who has contributed to fixing my jaw.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Mickey and I purchased our plane tickets today. They are non-refundable so it doesn't get any surer than this. We are leaving for Costa Rica very early in the morning on July 19. So, less than a month from today I will be going on my most exciting journey ever. One of my coworkers was asking me yesterday if I was scared. I'm really not. I'm anxious and excited. I'm happy to finally be getting my jaw fixed. I'm worried that I will have to put all of this on my credit card and pay interest for the rest of my life. Thankfully, I'm not scared. I've had surgeries before. I've watched members of my family have drastic surgeries with amazing results. That part doesn't frighten me in the slightest. The pain and the healing process I'm not really looking forward to, but that's the price you pay. As far as the traveling goes, I've done it before. For anyone who doesn't know, I saved every cent I made for almost eight years in order to travel to Europe with my sister a couple years ago. We were very naive in our travels. We had nothing: no itinerary, no specific plan. We only had tickets into and out of London and all the money we had saved. It was quite an adventure and we survived. So no, I'm not scared. I just hope that everyone says a prayer or two for safe travel, surgery as planned, and our safe return. Also, Mickey is returning about a week before me, so that he can get back to work. That part is a bit scary as well!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Okay, so it's a little more than two weeks, but close enough. As I mentioned in the previous post, Mickey and I fly out early on the 19th. In fact it's so early on the 19th we will be arriving at Portland International Airport late on the 18th to get through all of the security checks and such. I hate flying. For those of you who don't know, I have a serious breathing problem (that's the main reason I'm getting this surgery). Because of my nasal troubles, I have a terrible time flying. My ears only pop for pressure twice in each flight: once when we reach cruising altitude and once when we are landing. Anytime a plane adjusts altitude I'm in agony. Some of you have probably experienced crying babies on flights you've been on. They whine that their ears hurt...well, that's me. Yes, it hurts bad enough that it has made me cry on occasion. I have tried every remedy known to man for the pain, nothing helps. What I'm really looking forward to is the flight home. Maybe for the first time ever, I will be able to experience flight like everyone else!

Things are really falling into place with all of my doctors and I feel confident it will go smoothly overall. I'm going to my orthodontist today to have some adjustments made before my departure. They are adding little hooks to my wires so that my jaw will be easily rubber-banded together. On the 20th, the day after we arrive, I have my first appointment with my surgeon. On the 21st I meet with an internist down in Costa Rica to make sure that I am fit for surgery, and on the 22nd I go under the knife. When I got the dates last night it made everything real and a bit more scary. Mickey will be with me though and I have confidence in his abilities to keep me safe. Also, having the surgery right away gives me more time to heal while Mickey is still with me to help. Thanks again to everyone who has contributed to this adventure. Every penny helps and I truly appreciate the sacrifice. ]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Approximately 48 hours from now, Mickey and I will be headed for the airport. The swiftly approaching departure is a little bit frightening. There have been very few times in my life that I have felt as much stress as I'm feeling right now. I am sleeping a couple hours a night at this point, mostly tossing and turning and dreaming up frightening scenarios. Frankly, it sucks.

I have a goal for Costa Rica that has nothing to do with surgery. I seriously want to brush up on my Spanish skills. I'm going to take the Rosetta Stone software with me and I'm going to watch as much Spanish television as possible. I just found out that I need to show foreign language fluency in order to get the degree I'm working on right now. Since I haven't taken Spanish since 1998, I'm a tad bit rusty. My cousin, Danielle, lives in Mexico and can sometimes express her thoughts better in Spanish than English. Mickey's cousin, Julie, taught Spanish. At least I have people who can help me. I figure I might as well do something worthwhile as I lay in bed recuperating. Maybe when I return I will greet you will Hola instead of Hello. Maybe not. Maybe that's too big a goal for someone on lots of pain pills. 

Several people have asked, so for those of you who are worried, Remington, our sweet baby potbelly pig will be safely cared for by my sister and Mickey's brother. They are each taking a week of house sitting and pig sitting. He will be fine. I know he will miss us but if he gets food everyday, he'll forget about us in no time.

I will continue to update from Costa Rica. Stay tuned.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, we are safe and sound in Costa Rica. It has been a pretty uneventful day. We are definitely out of sorts, but we'll get the hang of it. It is the rainy season here. Which means it rains giant, huge, really wet drops all day and all night. We didn't bring an umbrella because we are Oregonians. Oregonians don't even own umbrellas. I have not seen one other person in this city without an umbrella. That's because trying to walk anywhere without one is insane. Everything we own is soaking wet. We want to go buy one but we can't get to the store without drowning. 

We tried to find a supermarket today based on directions from the woman we are staying with, ha! We just got soaked and lost so we still don't have an umbrella and we also don't have food. Don't worry. We ate. We went to the mall nearby. The internet here is far too slow for Mickey. He is not liking that one bit. The money is a little bit crazy too. I did a balance inquiring to try to get an exchange rate and surprise, in Costa Rica I am a millionaire.

We will get it figured out. Tomorrow the lady who runs our apartment is walking us to the doctor's office so we can find it. I'm sure she will help us secure an umbrella and try to give us directions to the store again. I also need to pay her for our stay. I just figured it out. I owe her 299,200 colones. It feels wrong putting that huge amount in an ATM. I think I will try the inside of a bank. ]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I waited in an uncomfortable, metal chair for many hours, waiting for word that Carrie was OK. I watched several episodes of Mythbusters dubbed in Spanish. I paced. I almost nodded off. Finally Dr. Vargas  emerged from behind the large swinging doors that led to Surgery.

<a href="http://fixmyjaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/carrie-recovery.jpg"><img class="right size-medium wp-image-27" title="carrie-recovery" src="http://fixmyjaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/carrie-recovery.jpg" alt="Carrie is out of surgery." width="236" height="186" /></a>He shook my hand and introduced me to Carrie's co-surgeon. Together they assured me that the operation was successful. It went according to plan, and they finished about a half-hour sooner than they promised. She was slowly waking up and would be in a recovery room soon. I immediately called Carrie's parents to let them know.

About an hour later, Carrie's bed was wheeled past me to the elevator. I took the stairs (three at a time) and met her on the floor below, where she was taken to her room. Once situated with monitors and bags of fluid, I was able to ask her how things were. She described her painful existence, and all I could do was tell her that things will be better. She is in good spirits despite the ordeal, and all she can do now is sleep and mend.]]></content:encoded>

It is raining outside. It is not the Costa Rican vacation that most folks imagine. I spent the night on a cot beside Carrie's bed. I have survived on cafeteria Empanadas and Coca Cola—two things that I can now order in near-perfect Spanish. Carrie has survived on intravenous fluids and some sort of rice beverage. Thunder is crackling and rain is pelting the roof of the atrium. Carrie is in moderate pain, but she is in good spirits.

Dr. Vargas visited today. He delivered quick, unfortunate news: Carrie would have to have her maxilla reset because her bite is not exactly what he was hoping for. Her teeth still don't match up perfectly. The surgeon is a skilled man, both with the knife and with bedside manner. He assured us that the hour-long readjustment would take place Monday after the initial swelling subsides, and Carrie could go home the same day. He explained that the jaw muscles are relaxed during surgery and this it is impossible to know how the jaws will interface once the muscles are again "awake." Because the maxilla is still only attached with four titanium plates, it will be relatively easy to maneuver. He left with a sympathetic smile, and—although we aren't elated with the news—Carrie is ready to complete the treatment.

We will spend one more night in the hospital. We are looking forward to returning to our apartment in San Pedro.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I cannot believe that I still have two more weeks until I get to go home. Three days of laying around doing nothing and I'm already going stir crazy. There are a lot of things I cannot do. For example, sitting at the computer is a challenge. When I'm sitting or standing I drool like a little baby. My lips are numb and swollen and I have no control over them. Mickey has more colorful names for my drool, but we won't go there. If I pay attention to it it's not a problem. Obviously, I am on a liquid diet. That is tricky too as liquid, like drool, comes careening out of my mouth as soon as I put it in. Eating is quite a chore. I find it tiresome and not satisfying. I have probably lost at least five pounds already. I'm glad there is no scale here so it will all be a big surprise when I get home. My face is so swollen that it actually hurts. It feels like my skin is tight enough that if you hit it, it might rip. I know it won't, but I swear that's what it feels like. I do see a small improvement each day, but my spirits are still low. It's hard to be here without my mom and dad. I'm really scared for Friday when Mickey leaves, and I have 8 days to fill with TV and blending my food. Now that I'm seeing improvement, the thought of going back into the hospital on Tuesday to basically start all over again is terrifying, and I miss Remington. 

Mickey's brother, Rob, is taking his turn at house and pig sitting for us. New Macs have cameras built right in so video chatting is a breeze. I did get to see little baby pig yesterday via Rob's computer, but it's not the same. Especially when Mickey's gone, feel free to email me. I will try to respond to everyone. I will be slowly going insane with boredom by that time so I need something to fill the time. Thanks to everyone who has sent their support.]]></content:encoded>

<title>The Night Before Surgery...Again</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am feeling great today. I must admit though, that feeling great today is a bit disheartening. I can't help thinking how healed and wonderful I would be by next Saturday if I didn't have to have the second surgery. It sucks a bit to know that I will probably feel as good as I do today, next Monday :( Oh well, there's nothing I can do about it at this point. 

I am still worried for when Mickey leaves. I'm not worried that I won't make it or I'll starve to death or anything. I can take care of myself. It's just nice to have the option of someone taking care of you. If you're tired and you don't want to get up, you don't have to. It has nothing to do with need. I'm also not very good at being by myself. I never have been. When I was in middle school, my mom used to pay my LITTLE sister to babysit me because I would scream and cry when they left. I didn't want to be home alone, but Jessie did. So, she got paid for the babysitting. How funny is that? 

I will be perfectly fine when he leaves. I will just be lonely and bored. Luckily, I brought lots of books. Most of you know how much I read. I brought mostly YA books because they don't require a lot of brain power. When you are on pain medicine reading Shakespeare is like, well, trying to understand an entire country around you that speaks Spanish, for example.

My surgery is scheduled for 10am tomorrow. I was told I would be going home around 4 or 5. Mickey will call with updates. I think his normal calls are his parents and mine so use the phone tree to get info. I'm sure he will post here too. Thanks again, to everyone.]]></content:encoded>

We met with Dr. Vargas to compare before and after images. What is immediately apparent in the image to the right is her new propensity to set off airport metal detectors with various 1mm-thick titanium plates and corresponding fasteners (I've included titanium's chemical symbol and atomic number for educational purposes).

I'm a bit apprehensive about leaving, but Any and Memo, the apartment owners, assure me that they will take good care of her. Any even offered to cook for her. So now it's a week of Carrie alone. Wish her luck.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[It seems silly that it should matter that Mickey's gone. When he was here I hung out in bed and he hung out at the computer. Any of you who know him well should understand that this is the status quo. When we lived in Oregon City and he had his own computer room, sometimes I wouldn't see him for days. I felt blessed when he got this laptop and started working in the living room in our new house. We finally got to spend some time in the same space. I love tv! He hates it. Mickey loves working on webpages and talking about different codes and things I don't understand. I hate it. So now we can both do what we love in the same space. Here, in Costa Rica, it was like old times. The laptop had to be plugged in so he was always in the other room. I guess just knowing he was there was nice. 

My first day alone has passed much like those before it. I hung out mostly in bed. I flipped through the few English channels we have and watched tv. I slept. I read some and I ate a lot of blended stuff and beverages. The only difference is that Mickey wasn't waiting on my like a princess. It's weird for me because he waits on me like a princess at home too. Taking care of myself for once is probably a good thing. For those of you who haven't been to our house, we have an arrangement. I don't cook and Mickey doesn't clean. I keep things organized and he feeds me. Admittedly, cleaning is a more arduous task, but Mickey makes it even. When he cooks for me, he makes me whatever I request. If we don't have the ingredients he goes to the store to get them. He cooks entirely on his own. I don't even go in the kitchen. He brings me beverages while I wait and he dishes up my plate and delivers it to me like a princess. He then clears my plate. I never go in the kitchen until I'm done. I hope I can manage these princess-free days. I've had to make like three blended things on my own already -oh the work! It was heaven to have him here. I couldn't have made it without him. I made it through the first day, though, and I'm sure I'll make it through the next seven. Mostly I can't wait to see my loved ones and Remington. If you haven't looked at the previous post with the xrays, do. It's cool.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am so bored! But as I pointed out to Mickey, I only have four and a half days until I'm home. I think anyone can manage that. I have almost no pain at this point. I haven't had pain pills for a couple days but I've been supplementing with Advil. There is something wonky that I do in my sleep. When I wake up in the morning or from a nap, my jaw just aches. That is pretty much the only time I have pain. The swelling, of course, is very uncomfortable and I still drool on occasion. But, for the most part, I am doing pretty well. I watch my five English channels, read a lot, and try to sleep as much as possible. Sleeping is great. It heals me and it makes the time go by faster. I usually take at least one nap midday. 

I just got back from the doctor. Everything is great and I get my sutures out on Friday. The doctor is really an amazing man. Since our first day here, we have never had to pay for a cab. A gentleman named Chico comes by and picks us up to take us wherever we have to go. Dr. Vargas pays for this. He is picking me up on Friday for my final appointment and also on Saturday morning to take me to the airport. Probably the most amazing thing is what Dr. Vargas offered me today. He said he wanted  me to make a good impression when I got home. So, he wanted to send me to a salon to get a makeover, on him. I am really shy about these sorts of things and have already made a hair appointment with my tried and true stylist for my return so I declined. But, what kind of doctor sends you to get a makeover before you go home? An amazing one.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Last Night in Costa Rica</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, tonight is my last night in Costa Rica. I must say that since I discovered a gecko in my apartment (yes, I know they are supposed to be good luck but they are creepy) I am glad to be leaving. It's not that I don't like Costa Rica. I just don't like it when I'm stuck in bed all day. Mickey keeps telling me to go for walks, but when I do I'm just exhausted and there is nothing close enough that I haven't already seen. 

In an hour I get my sutures out and I can finally brush my teeth properly. For those of you with braces in your past, brushing requires going below and above the bracket. Well since the surgery I haven't really been able to get at the side of the bracket that is attached to my gums. Yucky. Trust me. The first thing I'm going to do after the appointment is rush back and brush my teeth.

The Olympics start tonight which I am really excited for. That's how I will spend my last night. Eating Microwave Mac n' Cheese and watching the opening ceremonies. They start at 6:30 and I can't wait. The American network channels I get come out of Denver for some reason so I go by their time. I'm sure they will be broadcast on a Spanish channel here as well, but I'm going to watch NBC. My plans to learn Spanish have failed as I can't even speak English correctly with this swollen face :) Tomorrow at this time I will be on a plane to Houston and I can't wait. Say a prayer for my safe and speedy negotiation of the Houston airport. I have to go through customs, pick up my bags, and make it to my gate in just over an hour. That's cutting it close, or so I here. Thanks again for everyone's support!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today was the first day that I really did at-home things. Saturday night I was so tired from traveling and not being able to take my nap, that really all I did was eat dinner and go to bed. Yesterday I spent the whole day reading Breaking Dawn by Stephenie Meyer at my parent's house. If you've never read the Twilight series do. It's the final installment and I really enjoyed it. My mom made me all sorts of non-chewy delectables and made me feel very happy to be home. Melody, my boss at the television station told me I couldn't work until Thursday, so I have three whole days of nothing to do. Thus far I have cleaned Remington's kennel, bought some stuff online, and watered the lawn. It's been awesome to get back into the swing of things. Thanks again to every one who helped me through my time in Costa Rica. I did like it there. Everybody was incredibly kind and nice, but surgery is always hard. I probably won't go back. There are loads of other countries I've never seen. But, I did meet a lot of cool people I'd like to see again. Thanks to Any, Memo, Raquel, Chico, and Dr. Vargas.

I will keep updating as I heal. Currently, my chin area is at the tingly part of numbness. I still feel everything and it's really annoying. My cheeks, nose and upper lip are completely numb and swollen. I have like a three inch strip across my face that is totally non-functional. It makes me look really silly when I try to talk or smile. Jessie and Mickey keep trying to make me laugh because they like to make fun of me. I still drool a bit too, which I wish would just stop. I have almost no pain. I get sore if I do too much, but that's it. I still can't close my mouth or talk correctly yet. It'll get better.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, today is my first day going back to work. I guess it's about time. Next week I will be working both jobs, so I suppose I better just get over it and get my lazy butt moving. Eating is still pretty crazy. I can "kind of" chew soft things, but not really. Plus, I'm not really supposed to chew for two more weeks. When you can't close your mouth all the way, it's difficult and not very pretty to eat. I'm a bit scared about eating lunch with my friends at Cedar Ridge because we, as a group, have a nasty habit of making fun of sloppy eaters. I don't want to be "the" sloppy eater :( 

I have an appointment to get acupuncture tomorrow. I have been burned by insurance so many times that I was kind of scared to make the appointment. I called Healthnet and they referred me to ASH. I called them and they told me nothing except that I did have coverage through them somehow (maybe I should start reading my medical benefits booklet when I get it). So I called the doctor that had been recommended to me and his secretary was awesome. She explained everything to me and told me she would take care of it. So, I'm feeling much better about the situation. Apparently, I have access to a certain number of appointments that are covered through ASH if it is medically necessary. I'm guessing that complete numbness of the face would count as medically necessary. I am prepared to pay if insurance won't though. It's worth it. Plus, at this point, the more money I spend the better. I've spent so much myself on medical this year that I can't wait to do my taxes! Hooray for medical deductions (I'm trying to be glass half full here). Acupuncture is supposed to help the nerves heal quicker and more completely. I'm getting really tired of this nonfunctioning face of mine. I can handle the swelling, but the inability to move or feel my lips, cheeks, and nose is driving me crazy. I've never had acupuncture before so it should be another part of the adventure. Wish me luck!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I start back full time to both jobs tomorrow. I'm a little bit apprehensive about everyone seeing my new face. If you're wondering, that's why I haven't posted any pictures. I will post them. When I'm satisfied that I'm done healing, I will put in a bunch of before and after shots from different angles. The befores are terrible so I need to glam up for the afters to make the change drastic :)

My swelling has gone down a lot this week and I am getting some feeling back. I believe this is mostly due to acupuncture and several natural healing supplements that help with swelling. I haven't been taking them for the past three days though so it's slowing down. On Thursday morning I woke up with a sore shoulder. It felt like I had slept on it funny. By 8pm it was so excruciating that I was in tears. I cannot lay down or even lean against the cough without pain. It's really weird. You can massage it, push it, punch it. There are no marks of any sort. I have full range of motion, but when I breathe or lay down it hurts sooooo bad. I went to the ER early Friday morning when I had been up all night and couldn't take it anymore. The doctor gave me pain killers and muscle relaxers. They make me really sleepy and high, but they don't really help the pain. I have had to sleep sitting up on the couch every night since then. Today is the first day I feel like it's actually getting a bit better. Anyway, that's why I haven't been taking the supplements. They are for pain and swelling and I don't want to inundate my body with so many things that it rebels. Hopefully, my shoulder (they have no idea what's wrong with it) will fix itself soon and then I can concentrate on my jaw again. This is not the first serious injury I have gotten in my sleep. I'm thinking I should set up a motion sensor camera in my room so that I can see what the heck I'm doing to myself. Last time I damaged a nerve in my leg. I stood up in the morning and fell right back down. My leg was numb from the knee down for two weeks. I had to get physical therapy and a shock test. It was awful. Hopefully my shoulder injury wont be quite that drastic. Wish me luck with my busy schedule!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am so dang tired all the time. I realize it takes a while for your body to heal after trauma, but my schedule is just too busy for me to be this tired. When the alarm goes off every morning it is a hundred times harder to dribble out of bed and into the shower than it has ever been before. I am exhausted. Every day around eighth period, 1:30ish, I start to get this really awful headache. Advil can't touch it. Nothing can. I've had it all week. Man, I wish that would stop. Also, my braces are poking me EVERYwhere. Practically my whole mouth is covered in wax and still I get poked. Maybe I was getting poked before and now I can feel it. I don't know. I can't wait to see my orthodontist though. I see him on September 15 so I have to last over a week still. I hope it doesn't tear up my mouth too badly. 

Apparently the swelling is going down. Everyone tells me it is. It sure doesn't feel like it to me. It still feels awkward and disconnected and big and awful. I've been taking supplements for the swelling, but I don't know if they or time is responsible for the changes. I have also been getting acupuncture once a week. I don't know if it's helping or not. I do think I can feel more. The healing is slow so it's hard for me to tell there's any difference at all. I CAN open my mouth now. I yawned the other day and it just opened up. It opens almost as much as before surgery now, not comfortably, but still. I have read accounts of people who don't get that back until six months later, so maybe I'm a fast healer. Mickey is working Cycle Oregon this week so not only do I have to work both jobs, but I have to fend for myself. I hope I don't starve!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been meaning to post here for ages, but I keep remembering it when I'm away from the computer. I'm still pretty numb. The area between my eyes and upper lip does not work right. I spit a lot when I talk and my lips still don't close right. I look silly when I try to close them. I haven't had acupuncture for a couple weeks because it's just too dang hard to make time for it. I'm a busy lady and I don't like to spend my only free time getting needles jammed in my face. 

I went to the orthodontist last week for the first time since the surgery. He said my doctor did a spectacular job. I should be getting these darn things off in February if all goes as planned. I have all sorts of wacky contraptions on my teeth: extra wires here and there, rubberbands on hooks that I don't have to remove, extra lacing between specific teeth, plus they moved five brackets. I have three more appointments scheduled and then they should be coming off. Hopefully by then I will have more natural movement and feeling back.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I talked to Dr. Vargas today via email. He gave me some suggestions about vitamins to take that should help with the numbness. It's a pretty strict regiment, but I think I can handle it. As soon as I have time, I will go get all the vitamins and start the plan. It's basically a combination of different B vitamins that's supposed to help with numbness. I'm excited for the possibility of it helping. Mickey is too as he is sick and tired of me whining about my face.

I have also decided to put up some before and after pictures. I cannot do this myself as it is beyond my capabilities as far as web design goes. As some of you know, Mickey works on his own timeline. I would like for them to be up tonight, but it's more likely it will be sometime tomorrow or the next day. Go to the Pictures link on the main page and you can see some startling before and afters. Cheers!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I haven't posted here for awhile because there just wasn't much to post. My face is still numb, especially my lower lip and upper lip. I can't really make a kissy face or whistle. I can't feel my upper jaw at all. My top teeth and gums, no feeling whatsoever. I hope it comes back eventually. I can't really tell if it's getting better, because nerves heal so slowly that it's almost unnoticeable. I don't really like my new face, I decided. I didn't like my old face either, so it's not anything new. I look pretty good from a profile shot, but straight on, yuck!! Maybe I should just walk around presenting my profile to everyone I meet :) I have my second orthodontist appointment on December first. I'm supposed to get my very last wire that day. My teeth fit together perfectly, which I guess was the goal in all of this, but I still have a gummy smile. They can only move your face around so much. I still have a crooked smile and my center lines still aren't in the center. So basically, the medical necessity part of my treatment was a staggering success, but the cosmetic side of it was a failure in my opinion. I suppose that's karma. I will update after my appointment and let everyone know how the teeth are doing. In theory I should be getting my braces off in February. That will be exactly three years since I got them on for "thirteen months." ]]></content:encoded>
