This plugin utilizes reCAPTCHA (with support for Akismet) to help your blog stay clear of spams.

== Description ==

**Support for this plugin has been moved to [the BWP Community](http://betterwp.net/community/)!**

In the 21th century, spamming could be one of the most annoying problems for a website. Especially if you use some publishing platforms like WordPress, your blog WILL be spammed and no default methods will save you from such nightmare. This plugin utilizes the popular anti-spam library, reCAPTCHA, to help your blog stay clear of spams (especially when you integrate it with Akismet). Unlike the current WP-reCAPTCHA plugin, this one has a different approach and allows you to customize how the captcha looks using CSS.

**Some Features**

* Hide reCAPTCHA for qualified visitors
* Choose how the plugin reacts when an answer is wrong or empty
* Choose between 4 default themes or create your own (sample CSS and images provided)
* Choose a language you prefer, possibility to add more language if needed
* Option to load media files (CSS, JS, etc.) only when needed
* Possibility to integrate with Akismet, allowing better protection against spam and better end-users experience, i.e. "only force a CAPTCHA when a comment looks like spam".
* WordPress Multi-site compatible (not tested with WPMU)
* And more...

**Languages**

* English (default)
* Spanish - Espanol (es_ES) - Thanks to [Ivan Leomuro]!

The installation of this plugin will require additional work if you don't use `comment_form()` by default. Please read this plugin's [usage note](http://betterwp.net/wordpress-plugins/bwp-recaptcha/#usage) for more information.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `bwp-recaptcha` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress. After activation, you should see a menu of this plugin on your left. If you can not locate it, click on Settings under the plugin's name.
3. If you don't use `comment_form()` to print the comment form, please read [this usage note](http://betterwp.net/wordpress-plugins/bwp-recaptcha/#usage). Also, if you would like to have reCAPTCHA appearing below the textarea where your visitors type their comments, simply replace `comment_form()` in `comments.php` with this:
<pre><code>
if (function_exists('bwp_capt_comment_form')) {bwp_capt_comment_form();}
</code></pre>
4. Configure the plugin, and add your API keys. You must have API keys for the current domain for this plugin to work.
